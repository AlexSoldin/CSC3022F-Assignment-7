Question 1
-------------------
The minimum number of perceptrons required is 3.
The diagram below shows how the perceptrons were connected.

Inputs - x1 and x2
First layer perceptrons - P1 and P2
    P1 will be the weighted sum of x1 and x2 compared to a particular threshold value. P2 will be calculated using the same method.
    Both will have possible output of 0 or 1.
    The weighted sum of these outputs will be sent in to P3's threshold activation resulting in the final output.
    P1 - OR gate
    P2 - AND gate
    Therefore, P3 will learn to assing XOR using AND(NOT AND, OR)
Output layer perceptron - P3
    Possible output of 0 or 1 as result of XOR

Question 2
-------------------
The training examples used were many repitions of the four possible binary combinations that an XOR function operates on. These are shown below.

Input1  Input2  Output
     0       0       0
     1       0       1
     0       1       1
     1       1       0
     0       0       0
     1       0       1
     0       1       1
     1       1       0
     0       0       0
     1       0       1
     0       1       1
     1       1       0
     0       0       0
     1       0       1
     0       1       1
     1       1       0

The ANN took 14 training examples to learn the XOR operation while using random weights and a learning rate of 0.8.
Subsequent to each training iteration and updating of respective weights using the perception learning rule, the four binary combinations 
were tested to determine if the outputs were correct. This happened on the 14th iteration.

The ANN solved the XOR operation in 18 iterations using a learning rate of 0.6. A low learning rate and sufficiently large starting values may 
require more than 20 training iterations to solve the XOR operation.
